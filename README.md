# Recipe-Channel  

My small app designed to show recipes for tasty food.  
  
## How does it work?  
  
It is a Xamarin.Forms app that connects to my VPS server and downloads recipes from json file so they can be shown as a list on main page.  
  
I'm sorry but for now only recipes in polish language are supported.  
  
## Todo  

- [x] add search bar
- [ ] make details page look nicer
- [ ] add more recipes
  
  
### Screenshots  
  
Example views of the Main Page using Light Mode and Dark Mode are as follows:
